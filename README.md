## Installation

First off, you're going to need maven (as of now I suggest 3.8.4) so you can run the `mvn package` command command and Java 11 or 12 or something. Or just download it from the build artifacts.

### Setup

Add the plugin to your server's `plugins/` folder

## Usage

Run `/help crypt` for a list of commands

## Other
This plugin was created for a private server, I just decided to open source it for the heck of it.
